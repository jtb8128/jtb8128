- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jtb8128
My name is Trevor.
I have worked in school management in trying to present performance data in useful ways to teachers using R, perl, LaTeX.
I program in perl, R and python.
I'm currently working as a data analyst in a manufacturing firm.
Github is new to me as I work alone rather than in teams so I'm looking forward to learning how to use it well.
